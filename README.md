## Warning

The folder `Music` contains all the music `.mp3` files. This is ignored by default.

Be warned that you must run through the program `generate_label_csv.py` to generate the album cover. After that, the path of the album cover in csv will be valid.

You can download music by `spotdl`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The example are all in `main.py`, all you need to do is

```

Then, you are done.
